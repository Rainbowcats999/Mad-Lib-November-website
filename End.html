            <h1>The Shy Kid Becomes A Karate Legend: Part 2</h1>
            <p>  
            On Halloween dance night, when Daniel dresses up as a shower for Halloween, he gets revenge on Johnny
            by spraying him with a water house. Then Johnny and his buddies follow him out of the party and begin chasing him,
            cauing a destruction and crash on the road. Then Daniel is forced to surrender since there are five of the opponents and only one of him.
            Suddenly, Mr. Miyagi appears out of nowhere and takes down Johnny and his friends. The next day Mr. Miyagi and Daniel visit the 
            all mighty-bad a** dojo known as Cobra Kai, taught by Sensei Kreese. Mr. Miyagi convinces Sensei Kreese to tell his students
            to leave Daniel alone while he trains for the upcoming annual tournament. During that time, Daniel continued to train with 
            Mr. Miyagi. Mr. Miyagi teaches Daniel very unusual methods of karate that he's never seen before. Such as washing cars, sanding the floor and painting the house.
            When the day of the tournament finally came Daniel dressed up in his uniform and began the fight. However he gets set back by Tommy,
            who kicks him in the knee, paralyzing Daniel. But Mr. Miyagi heals Daniel and he faces off against his toughest opponent, Johnny. In the end, Daniel ends up winning,
            making Mr. Miyagi, his mom, and Ally happy, while Cobra Kai gets very mad. The End
