        <h1>The Shy Kid Becomes A Karate Legend: Part 1</h1>
        <p> Hello audience! You've heard some rumors online about it, but do you want to know the real story?
        Keep your eyes and ears open because this story is one to tell! I have decided to take some time out of my life to formally introduce to you, the person I'm going to be writing a story about. Now this kid is a true legend, where he came from and where he got to today is truly an amazing and inspirational story. Daniel LaRusso, 18, who moved from Newark, New Jersey to Recita, Califronia. He never wanted this kind of life, moving away from all his friends and only being with his single, struggling mom. He deeply hated his new living environment, a small, filthy old apartment was not the kind of living condition that he was used to, but sadly for Daniel, this was just all his family could afford. On his first day of school, Daniel meets a girl and instantly falls in love with her, her name was Ally. Just as he thought that this could 
        make his misery better, boy was he wrong. Little did he know, that his new crush, was actully the ex-girlfriend of his new soon to be bully, Johhny Lawernce. This breakup turned on a lot of insecurties for Johnny, and he wanted to get Ally back, and he wouldn't allow some new kid to just steal her girl because come on now, what kind of guy would do that. Anyways, the dissappearance of his girlfriend made him very miserable. When Daniel was offically a student at that new school, Johnny became his rival, which made Daniel hate that environment even more. One night at the beach, Daniel met up with Ally and then Johnny swooped in with his friends and began  
        verbally harassing Ally, by taking her radio. Daniel tried to save her but Johnny easily overpowered him. Shortly after that night, the sink in Daniel's apartment had broke and his mom requested that he see the maintance man to fix it. This is when Daniel received his other surprise. The man, who's name is Mr. Miyagi was actually a master at karate. He found out about Daniel's situation and decided to help. The reason that Johnny beat Daniel so hard is because, he's been training in a dojang that Daniel later discovers is called "Cobra Kai," where all the students train under the sensei John Kreese. At first Daniel thought that Johnny was the one to blame, but Mr.Miyagi later explains there's no such thing as a bad student, only a bad teacher.
